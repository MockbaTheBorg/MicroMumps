# Z80 MicroMumps 4.06 for CP/M

This is a restoration of the original MicroMumps 4.06 for CP/M which I have been working on for the last 2 years, together with my RunCPM and CPMduino emulators.
This code will build through the tniasm Z80 compiler, BAT files provided.

IMPORTANT: For SETMUMPS.COM you have to pass on the command line the name of the mumps executable you want to modify. Example: SETMUMPS MUMPS.COM.
Then it will look for the correct file name (as I have both MUMPS.COM and MUMPSB.COM).

This project was blessed by Professor Richard "Dick" Walters, original author of the code, and to whom I dedicate all the effort of putting this together.

There may be someone else out there who would also like to have this on their collection, so here it is.

This project is dedicated to the memory of Professor Emeritus Richard F. Walters
